!!Lots of tests around request matcher!! headers, body, etc, missing tests

RUN AS ADMIN

REC??????

More complex object for request creator url
.Query (true, blah)

// test query all variations
// testing query func, remove query from request url and pass through on function, do the same on response creator????????????????????

log stuff apart from exceptions when log or recorder on?

log, rec, rec, stop?
wildcard

Global teardown needs to stop listener!!! documentation, uses http proxy listener localhost:8080, admin permissions
Document all public properties on nock object? Config
Documentation - stop nock when all tests complete, all examples, body matcheers, headers response crewators etc, run as admin
start and stop, asserting nock called/used
JSON example on body matching?

417???????? Document it, when passing through

body matcher, what about JSON

simulating web client errors, general errors httpclient errors!!! exception types

test different status codes, 500 etc and web exceptions? maybe just having a 500 etc causes this? 
417 at moment, maybe configurable, setting on nock for default status code in request error

test with lamda and function examples? put this stuff in readme for header and body matching?

***
tests around web client etc, exceptions????
test 301 redirect with location headers???
***

test with invalid urls, timeout?? etc?

log record

Look at node nock, query!!!! if implemented put in documentation

Add a remove interceptor function to remove nock from nocked requests, documenta

Request Body filtering

isDone
remove interceptor
log
record
headers
body,
query
wildcard
static props


what usually happens with 500 errors etc?


COMPARE TO NOCK DOCUMENtation

GLOBAL SETUP and teardown
response headers!!


proxying requests etc, must be able to post blah blah? and send body data??, tests?

Nock.Nock? test in external project can I sort this?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12050415/set-default-proxy-programmatically-instead-of-using-app-config

readme new functions and usage, proxy port config? host localhost?

reply with exceptions?

document static defaults

Remove console .logs or add nocking logs options???????

number of times when been decorated with times, should done be true when called the defined number?
Maybe times should not add multiple NockedRequests, it should decrement a counter of times? blah blah

test with WEbClient and HttpWebRequest and WEbRequest?

// Need a test POST that checks body (inputstream read), then has custom response (input stream read)


Do I NEED NOCKED REQUEST OBJECT.!.!.!.!.!.!.!

NEED BETTER TESTS AROUND NOCK TESTS BUILDING OBJECTS, Not asserting nocked request is correct properly

More tests around building objects and request matchers and body matchers!

port config, static var with default

need to kill listener if complete
